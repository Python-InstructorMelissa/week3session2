Using the following website

https://www.w3schools.com/sql/trysql.asp?filename=trysql_select_all

Queries we ran:
SELECT * FROM Orders LEFT JOIN Customers on Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID LEFT JOIN Employees ON Orders.EmployeeID = Employees.EmployeeID LEFT JOIN Shippers ON Orders.ShipperID = Shippers.ShipperID WHERE Orders.CustomerID = 92;
    - This query joins the foreign key tables so that we can view all the information that pertains to the order the customer that we added created.
SELECT * FROM Orders LEFT JOIN Customers on Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID LEFT JOIN Employees ON Orders.EmployeeID = Employees.EmployeeID LEFT JOIN Shippers ON Orders.ShipperID = Shippers.ShipperID WHERE Shippers.ShipperID = 2;
    - Using the same type of query we are now pulling multiple records by looking for all the orders that a specific Shipper has
SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE Country = "USA";
    - Selects all data from Customers table that have a country listed as USA
UPDATE Customers SET City = "Dallas" WHERE CustomerID = 93;
    - Changed the values of the city for 1 record


Using Week3Session1 ERD DATA:
SELECT * FROM user LEFT JOIN list ON user_id = user.id;
    - Will pull all users and all from list but joining on the user id.


UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE = Will only effect 1 row / record / object
SELECT = can be used to pull 1 or many records
